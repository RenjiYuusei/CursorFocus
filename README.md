## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Gemini API Key (required for AI-powered features)

## API Key Setup

Before running CursorFocus, you need to set up your Gemini API key:

1. Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

2. Set up the environment variable:

   For Windows:
   ```bash
   set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   For Mac/Linux:
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   To make it permanent:
   - Windows: Add to system environment variables
   - Mac/Linux: Add to `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or equivalent shell config file

## Multi-Project Support

CursorFocus can monitor multiple projects simultaneously. There are two ways to set this up:

### 1. Automatic Project Detection

Run CursorFocus with the scan option to automatically detect projects:
```bash
python CursorFocus/setup.py --scan /path/to/projects/directory
```

This will:
- Scan the directory for supported project types
- List all detected projects
- Let you choose which projects to monitor

### Project Types Supported:
- Chrome Extensions (detected by manifest.json)
- Node.js Projects (detected by package.json)
- Python Projects (detected by setup.py or pyproject.toml)
- React Applications (detected by src/App.js)
- Generic Projects (basic structure)

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up manually:

1. Install dependencies (Python 3.6+ required):
   ```bash
   cd CursorFocus
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Create/edit config.json (optional)
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 focus.py
   ```

## Generated Files

CursorFocus automatically generates and maintains three key files:

1. **Focus.md**: Project documentation and analysis
   - Project overview and structure
   - File descriptions and metrics
   - Function documentation
   
2. **.cursorrules**: Project-specific Cursor settings
   - Automatically generated based on project type
   - Customized for your project's structure
   - Updates as your project evolves

## Setup

1. Clone or copy the CursorFocus directory to your project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RenjiYuusei/CursorFocus.git CursorFocus
   ```

2. Install dependencies (Python 3.6+ required):
   ```bash
   cd CursorFocus
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python focus.py
   ```

## Output

CursorFocus generates a `Focus.md` file in your project root with:

1. Project Overview
   - Project name and description
   - Key features and version
   - Project type detection

2. Project Structure
   - Directory hierarchy
   - File descriptions
   - Function listings with detailed descriptions
   - File type detection
   - File length alerts based on language standards

3. Code Analysis
   - Key function identification
   - Detailed function descriptions
   - File length standards compliance
